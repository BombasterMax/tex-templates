# LETI TeX templates

Featuring 3 types of templates to make making notes&assignments much easier and faster:
- lab
- math assignment
- lecture

These templates based on LETI teachers requirements and GOST standarts. Using fontspec to manage fonts and its size. I am using tex-live and XeLateX as a compilator. There also was an attempt to use non-proprietary fonts. You can change it as you want or download mine from your distro repos

Lecture template was made with a huge help from [mxkrsv](https://github.com/mxkrsv).
